## Standup: Feb. 22

**Function 1:**
Progress:
- Basic framework for trajectory plotting
- Resetting axes

Future deliverables and challenges:
- step-by-step plotting of line representing trajectory
- bokeh speed of plotting steps vs. necessary speed of visualization

**Function 2:**
Progress:
- merging of particle chemistry data with Deff distributions

Future deliverables and challenges:
- plotting of distributions with interactive x-axis dropdowns
- figuring out how to select relevant data for each dropdown case
  - mine old HW3 code for if statement strategy

**Function 3:**
Progress:
- calculation of geometric mean of MSD and Deff for each timepoint and appending to dataframe

Future deliverables and challenges:
- function to return average Deff from user inputtable timepoint range
  - also shows histogram of Deffs from that range
