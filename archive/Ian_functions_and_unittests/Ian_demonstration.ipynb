This provides a point of comparison for the chemistry-subcategory-specific histograms given by the functions_rick.py file.  compute_plot_all_Deff also prints the individual Deff from the input particle chemistry of interest, and provides a histogram of all Deffs from that chemistry while also showing how those Deffs compare to Deffs of other chemistries over time."
