## Purpose

This experiment was meant to demonstrate the differences in diffusive behavior
between PS and PS-PEG particles within a gel model of the brain.  Two different
types of gels were prepared: one with calcium chloride in ACSF and one without
calcium chloride in ACSF.

## Evaluation

The data turned out to yield high-quality results.  Using four samples for each
condition, I was able to demonstrate statistically significant differences
between PS particles with and without calcium, while PS-PEG particles didn't
alter behavior in different medias.

However, it was determined after the experiment that the data can't be used as
of now, because confocal tracking hasn't been verified as equivalent to camera
tracking.  I will need to redo the above experiment using the camera instead.

I will defer redoing this experiment for the time being, because I want to
focus on my aggregation datasets for now.  Diffusion datasets may not make it
into the first paper.
