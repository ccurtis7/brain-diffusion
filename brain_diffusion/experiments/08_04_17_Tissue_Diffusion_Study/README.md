## Purpose

This experiment was planned to examine the diffusive behavior of PS and PS-PEG
NPs in the cortex region of P10 WT pups.  However, due to time constraints as
well as a limited number of pups, I chose to only collect data for PS-PEG from
this litter.

I was able to get 4 pups for this experiment, and I took 5 slices from each pup.

## Evaluation

09.21.17
I was able to get statistically significant numbers of particles, and I used a
DAPI stain to verify that I was in tissue.  However, it was still hard sometimes
to determine if I was definitely in tissue.  Sometimes I was near holes, other
times I couldn't tell if I was too near the bottom of the slice to clearly
state that I wasn't at the tissue-plate interface.  This is something I have
yet to resolve.

Part of this is due to two factors: (1) the particles move so slowly, it is hard
for them to reach deep into tissue at all and (2) I have been trying to
minimize incubation time with particles, sometimes incubating only for half an
hour or less.  This limits the areas where particles can get to.

Either way, the particles I observed in tissue didn't move very quickly, and
when I plotted their average MSD, it plateaued out at 2 um2 after 5 seconds.
This doesn't reflect the behavior I get in gels, or behavior I have reported
in the past.

I am going to have to re-do this dataset anyway, because we need to collect all
diffusion data using camera and not confocal.
