## Purpose

I designed this experiment to evaluate the difference in diffusive behavior
between PS and PS-PEG NPs in gels prepared using ACSF.

## Evaluation

While collecting the data, I was surprised to find that PS nanoparticles didn't
form large aggregates in the gels.  In previous experiments using ACSF as my
base media for the gels, PS particles formed large aggregates and didn't move at
all.  In this case, PS particles were free to move.  I attributed this change
in behavior to the way I prepared my ACSF for the gels.  

After this experiment, I standardized my media preparation to control for
temperature (25 or 37C), CO2 level (5%, rather than bubbled), and pH (7.2).
